# Sparqlee

A simple SPARQL expression evaluator library.

## Using Sparqlee

Note: If you want to use *aggregates*, or *exists* you should check out the [stream section](#streams).

### Installation

This package is available on [(TODO)npm]('blurb').

### Evaluating

**TODO** Add section about creating an evaluator and passing bindings.

### Streams

**TODO** Add section about streams and their relation to _aggregates_ and _exists_.

### Errors

**TODO** Add section about Errors, and specifically about Expression Errors.

## Spec compliance

**TODO** Add section about differences from the spec and which functions are affected (and which are implemented).

## Setup locally

1. Install `yarn` (or `npm`) and `node`.
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. Use these evident commands (or check `package.json`):
    * building once: `yarn run build`
    * build and watch: `yarn run watch`
    * testing: `yarn run test`
    * benchmarking: `yarn run bench`

### Testing

Running tests will generate a `test-report.html` in the root dir.
**TODO** Explain test organizatian and expression tables
